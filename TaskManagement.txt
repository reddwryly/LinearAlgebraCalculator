notes:
    *needs to be able to solve the systems of equations when the solution is infinite (parametrically)

to do:
    *gaussian_elimination()
    *matrix_multiplication()
    *add more matrix opperations (transpose, trace, addition, etc.)
    *UI, windows for each calculator + menu/selector page 
        -input for each element in the matrix (dynamic ammount depending on dim)
        -shows each steps (math papa style)
        -reset features + does not save values or results after switching pages
        -back to menu navigation

Delegation:
    Riley:
        *gaussian_elimination
            -infinite solution

    Braeden: 
        *guassian_jordan_elimination
        *UI inputs

complete: 
    *check_for_swap()
    *get_matrix_from_user()
